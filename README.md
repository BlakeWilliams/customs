# Customs

Customs is a Go application that is designed to lint pull requests and diffs
using configurable rules. It is language agnostic, passing the relevant pull
request and diff information to scripts via JSON while using the resulting stdout JSON to comment on the PR/diffs, fail the build, etc.
